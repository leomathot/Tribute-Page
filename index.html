        <p>René Favaloro was born in 1923 and raised in La Plata, Argentina. After graduating from high school, he was admitted to the School of Medicine at the National University of La Plata. During his third year, he began his medical residency. He graduated with a medical degree in 1949.</p>
        <p>He moved to a small town named Jacinto Aráuz in La Pampa Province after being offered a job as the town's doctor. He married María Antonia Delgado in 1951.</p>
        <p>Favaloro and his brother endeavored to improve the general level of health in what was then a remote region. They trained and educated the general public, teachers, and nurses and improved health-care delivery.</p>
        <p>Favaloro became interested in developments in cardiovascular intervention, and developed an enthusiasm for thoracic surgery. During a visit to La Plata, he met Professor Mainetti, who pointed him in the direction of the Cleveland Clinic. Although he had doubts about leaving his profession as a rural physician, he thought that he could make a greater contribution to the community on returning from the United States.</p>
        <p>Favaloro would spend hours and hours reviewing coronary angiograms and studying coronary arteries and their relation with the cardiac muscle.</p>
        <p>In early 1967, Favaloro began to consider the possibility of using the saphenous vein in coronary surgery. The basic principle was to bypass a diseased (obstructed) segment of a coronary artery in order to deliver blood flow distally. The standardization of this technique, called coronary artery bypass surgery radically changed the treatment of coronary disease.</p>
        <p>Favaloro returned to Argentina in 1971. He founded the Fundación Favaloro in 1975 along with several collaborators. He took pride in having trained more than 450 residents from all over Argentina and the Americas. Favaloro contributed to raise the standard level of his specialty for the benefit of patients through innumerable courses, seminars, and conferences organized by the Fundación.</p>
        <p>In 1992 the nonprofit Favaloro Foundation Institute of Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery (Instituto de Cardiología y Cirugía Cardiovascular de la Fundación Favaloro) opened in Buenos Aires. This institute offers highly specialized services of cardiology, cardiovascular surgery and heart, lung, cardiopulmonary, liver, kidney, and bone marrow transplants, among other areas.</P>
        <P>Despite the immense costs of bypass surgery, Dr Favaloro operated daily on indigent patients, something that he felt was both a necessity and his obligation.</p>
